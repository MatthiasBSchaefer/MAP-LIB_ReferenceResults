The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 524
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  524
scalar unknowns and
  505+(if  not Connections.isRoot(body.frame_a.R) then 13 else 22)+(if   spring.lineForce.fixedRotationAtFrame_a then 12 else 3)+(if spring.lineForce.fixedRotationAtFrame_b   then 12 else 3)
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
