This is translation 47 of 54
Translation of ModelicaTest.MultiBody.Forces.Spring2:
The DAE has 2355 scalar unknowns and 2355 scalar equations.
The translated model contains large nonlinear systems of equations. The simulation may run faster in DAE mode. Enable DAE mode by setting the flag Advanced.Define.DAEsolver and use one of the solvers Dassl, Radau IIa, Esdirk*, or Sdirk34hw.
