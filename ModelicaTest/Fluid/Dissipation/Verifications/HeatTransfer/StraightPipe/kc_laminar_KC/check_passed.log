This is check 78 of 82
Check of ModelicaTest.Fluid.Dissipation.Verifications.HeatTransfer.StraightPipe.kc_laminar_KC:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 136
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  109+9*n
scalar unknowns and
  97+13*n
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  136
