This is check 26 of 46
Check of ModelicaTest.Fluid.Dissipation.Verifications.HeatTransfer.StraightPipe.kc_overall_KC:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 160
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  133+9*n
scalar unknowns and
  121+13*n
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  160
