The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 90
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  86+n
scalar unknowns and
  90
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  90
