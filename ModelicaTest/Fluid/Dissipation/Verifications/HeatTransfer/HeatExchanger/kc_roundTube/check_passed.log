The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 50
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  42+2*n
scalar unknowns and
  50
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  50
