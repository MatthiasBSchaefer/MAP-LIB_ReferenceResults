This is check 9 of 46
Check of ModelicaTest.Fluid.Dissipation.Verifications.HeatTransfer.HeatExchanger.kc_flatTube:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 46
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  42+2*n
scalar unknowns and
  46
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  46
