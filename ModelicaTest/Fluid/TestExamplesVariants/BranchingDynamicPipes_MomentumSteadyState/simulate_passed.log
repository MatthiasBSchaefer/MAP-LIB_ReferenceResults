ERROR: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.
  Time: 2.223821504946442
  Tag: simulation.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics

  Jacobian inverse norm estimate: 3.72994e+09
  Condition number estimate: 4.15354e+09
  1-norm of the residual = 0.600792
  The estimates indicate that the Jacobian is close to singular, suggesting that there is no solution.

  Last value of the solution:
    pipe3.state_a.X[1] = 0.01
    pipe3.port_a.h_outflow_inStream = 51944.1
    pipe2.port_a.m_flow = 0.00389396
  Last value of the residual:
    { -0.000187084, 0.600605, 1.73472E-18 }
