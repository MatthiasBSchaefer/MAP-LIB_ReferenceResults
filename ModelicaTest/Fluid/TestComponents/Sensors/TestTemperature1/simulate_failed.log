Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dynasim))
Error: The following error was detected at time: 6.990399065834207
  OnePortTemperature and TwoPortTemperature shall give the same result
  Failed condition: abs(Tdiff)/50 < 0.001

Integration terminated before reaching "StopTime" at T = 6.99
