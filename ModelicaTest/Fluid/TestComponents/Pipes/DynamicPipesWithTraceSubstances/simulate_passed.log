  regFun3(): Derivatives at data points do not allow co-monotone interpolation, as both are non-zero, of opposite sign and have an absolute value larger than machine eps (y0d = -0.585506, y1d = 0.000111208). Please correct arguments.

ERROR: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.
  Time: 5.000189166417342
  Tag: simulation.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics

  Jacobian inverse norm estimate: 571337
  Condition number estimate: 9.97765e+09
  1-norm of the residual = 30.055
  The estimates indicate that the Jacobian is close to singular, suggesting that there is no solution.

  Last value of the solution:
    pipe6.port_a.m_flow = 0.00423218
    pipe8.state_b.T = 349.024
    pipe8.state_b.p = 133026
  Last value of the residual:
