ERROR: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.
  Time: 0.503586
  Tag: simulation.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics
