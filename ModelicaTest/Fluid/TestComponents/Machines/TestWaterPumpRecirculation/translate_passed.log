Translation of ModelicaTest.Fluid.TestComponents.Machines.TestWaterPumpRecirculation:
The DAE has 131 scalar unknowns and 131 scalar equations.
Warning: We cannot differentiate equations for the following variables having stateSelect = StateSelect.prefer.
They will be treated as if they had stateSelect = StateSelect.default:
