This is translation 26 of 91
Translation of ModelicaTest.Fluid.TestComponents.Machines.TestWaterPumpNPSH:
The DAE has 146 scalar unknowns and 146 scalar equations.
Warning: We cannot differentiate equations for the following variables having stateSelect = StateSelect.prefer.
They will be treated as if they had stateSelect = StateSelect.default:
  pump.medium.h
  pump.medium.p
