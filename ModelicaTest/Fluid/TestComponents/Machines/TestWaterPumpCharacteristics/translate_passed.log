This is translation 18 of 91
Translation of ModelicaTest.Fluid.TestComponents.Machines.TestWaterPumpCharacteristics:
The DAE has 324 scalar unknowns and 324 scalar equations.
Warning: We cannot differentiate equations for the following variables having stateSelect = StateSelect.prefer.
They will be treated as if they had stateSelect = StateSelect.default:
  pump.medium.h
  pumpLinear.medium.h
  pumpPolynomial.medium.h
  pumpQuadraticLinear.medium.h
