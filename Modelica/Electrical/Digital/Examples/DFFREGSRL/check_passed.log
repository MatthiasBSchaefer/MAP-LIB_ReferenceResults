This is check 79 of 422
Check of Modelica.Electrical.Digital.Examples.DFFREGSRL:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 43
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  35+4*dFFREGSRL.dFFSR.n
scalar unknowns and
  37+3*dFFREGSRL.dFFSR.n
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  43
