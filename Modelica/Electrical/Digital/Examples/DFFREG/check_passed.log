This is check 76 of 422
Check of Modelica.Electrical.Digital.Examples.DFFREG:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 40
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  32+4*dFFREG.dFFR.n
scalar unknowns and
  34+3*dFFREG.dFFR.n
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  40
