The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 50
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  50
scalar unknowns and
  48+(if  not cable.useHeatPort then 1 else 0)+(if  not diode.useHeatPort then 1   else 0)
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  50
