Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dassault Systemes))

ERROR: Failed to solve nonlinear system using Newton solver.
  Time: 58.00104891054862
  Tag: simulation.nonlinear[1]

  Common causes:
   * The system of equations has no solution - the residual will be above zero.
     - In some cases the event-logic can cause this.
   * Starting values are too far from the solution.
     - In rare cases this could occur at events.
   * The equations are too discontinuous for the nonlinear solver - the residual will have knees.
     - Likely caused by over-using noEvent.

  To get more information consider the options:
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/Generate listing of translated Modelica code in dsmodel.mof
   * Simulation/Setup/Translation/List non-linear iteration variables
   * The options under the group Simulation/Setup/Debug/Nonlinear solver diagnostics

  Jacobian inverse norm estimate: 3.18221e+08
  Condition number estimate: 4.54167e+08
  1-norm of the residual = 70.3642
  The estimates indicate that the Jacobian is close to singular, suggesting that there is no solution.

  Last value of the solution:
    T2.vt_t = 0.0255607
    T2.veb = 5.76044E-08
    T1.vt_t = 0.0198541
    T1.veb = 0.88377
    RI.p.v = 0.180197
  Last value of the residual:
    { -61.1853, -6.99324E-08, -8.47501, -0.703934, -2.19491E-11 }
