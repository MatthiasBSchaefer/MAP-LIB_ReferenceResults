Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dassault Systemes))

... Warning message from dymosim
At time T = 2.130369e-08 in current integration interval
T_interval = 0.000000e+00 ... 2.000000e-04
a large amount of work has been expended
(about 500 steps) in the integrator. Probably the communication
interval is too large or the system is stiff.
