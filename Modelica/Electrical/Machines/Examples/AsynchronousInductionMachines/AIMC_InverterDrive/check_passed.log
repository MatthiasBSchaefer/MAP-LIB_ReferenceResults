This is check 375 of 422
Check of Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.AsynchronousInductionMachines.AIMC_InverterDrive:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 1064
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  1055+gridCurrent.ToSpacePhasor1.m+machineCurrent.ToSpacePhasor1.m+  toSpacePhasor.m
scalar unknowns and
  1058+gridCurrent.ToSpacePhasor1.m+machineCurrent.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  1064
