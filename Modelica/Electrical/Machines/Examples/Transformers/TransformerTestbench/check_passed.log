The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 772
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  760+currentQuasiRMSSensorS.ToSpacePhasor1.m+voltageQuasiRMSSensorS.ToSpacePhasor1.m  +voltageRMSSensorL.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensorL.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  766+currentQuasiRMSSensorL.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensorS.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
