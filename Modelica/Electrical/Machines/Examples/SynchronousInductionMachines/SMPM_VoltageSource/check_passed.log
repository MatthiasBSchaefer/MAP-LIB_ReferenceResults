The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 745
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  739+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  742+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  745
