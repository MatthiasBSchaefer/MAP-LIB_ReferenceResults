This is check 102 of 422
Check of Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMPM_CurrentSource:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 660
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  648+2*currentController.m+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+  currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  651+2*currentController.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  654+2*currentController.m
Check of Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMPM_CurrentSource successful.
