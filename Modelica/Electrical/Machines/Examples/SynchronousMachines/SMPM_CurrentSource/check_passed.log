The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 659
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  647+2*dqToThreePhase.m+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  650+2*dqToThreePhase.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  653+2*dqToThreePhase.m
