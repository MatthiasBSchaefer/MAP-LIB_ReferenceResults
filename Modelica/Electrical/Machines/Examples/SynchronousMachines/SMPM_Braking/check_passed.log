The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 653
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  647+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  650+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  653
