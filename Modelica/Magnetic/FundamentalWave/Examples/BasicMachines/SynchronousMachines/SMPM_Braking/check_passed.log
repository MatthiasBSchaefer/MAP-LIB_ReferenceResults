This is check 396 of 422
Check of Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave.Examples.BasicMachines.SMPM_Braking:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 818
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  812+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  815+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  818
