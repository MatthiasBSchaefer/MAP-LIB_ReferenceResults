This is check 398 of 422
Check of Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave.Examples.BasicMachines.SMEE_LoadDump:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 1074
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  1065+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m  +booleanReplicator.nout
scalar unknowns and
  1068+booleanReplicator.nout+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  1074
