This is check 395 of 422
Check of Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave.Examples.BasicMachines.SMPM_VoltageSource:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 911
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  905+voltageQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar unknowns and
  908+currentQuasiRMSSensor.ToSpacePhasor1.m
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given bindings parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  911
Check of Modelica.Magnetic.FundamentalWave.Examples.BasicMachines.SMPM_VoltageSource successful.
