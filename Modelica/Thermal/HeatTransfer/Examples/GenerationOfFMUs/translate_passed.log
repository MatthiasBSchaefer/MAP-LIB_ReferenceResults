This is translation 422 of 422
Translation of Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.Examples.GenerationOfFMUs:
The DAE has 102 scalar unknowns and 102 scalar equations.
Redundant consistent initial conditions.
Removed the following equations which are redundant and consistent: 
  if (inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.use_pder and inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.use_pder2)     then 
    inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u = Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.Adaptors.Functions.state2      ({inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.p, inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u1,       inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u2}, time);
  elseif (inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.use_pder and  not     inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.use_pder2) then 
    inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u = Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.Adaptors.Functions.state1      ({inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.p, inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u1},       time);
  else
    inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.u = inverseCapacity.temperatureToHeatFlow.p;
  end if;
 
This required evaluation of 
the interactive start values of 
    directCapacity.heatCapacitor.T(start = 293.15)
    inverseCapacity.mass.T(start = 293.15)
 
The redundancies involve
active start values: 
  inverseCapacity.mass.T = 293.15;
  directCapacity.heatCapacitor.T = 293.15;
