This is check 305 of 422
Check of Modelica.Fluid.Examples.TraceSubstances.RoomCO2WithControls:
The model has the same number of unknowns and equations: 829
The model could not be deduced to be symbolically well-posed.
The model has
  828+max([size(NumberOfPeople.columns, 1); size(NumberOfPeople.offset, 1)])
scalar unknowns and
  820+(if ductOut.massDynamics == Modelica.Fluid.Types.Dynamics.SteadyState then 2   else 4)+max([size(NumberOfPeople.columns, 1); size(NumberOfPeople.offset, 1)])  +(if ductIn.massDynamics == Modelica.Fluid.Types.Dynamics.SteadyState then 2   else 4)
scalar equations.
However, exploiting the given numerical settings of parameters gives the same number of unknowns and equations:
  829
