Translation of Modelica.Fluid.Examples.AST_BatchPlant.Test.OneTank:
The DAE has 126 scalar unknowns and 126 scalar equations.
Warning: The initial conditions are not fully specified.
Dymola has selected default initial conditions.
Warning: Assuming fixed start value for the continuous states:
    tank.level(start = tank.level_start)
