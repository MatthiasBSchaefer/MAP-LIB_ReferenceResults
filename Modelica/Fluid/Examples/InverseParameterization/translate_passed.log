This is translation 306 of 422
Translation of Modelica.Fluid.Examples.InverseParameterization:
The DAE has 287 scalar unknowns and 287 scalar equations.
Warning: We cannot differentiate equations for the following variables having stateSelect = StateSelect.prefer.
They will be treated as if they had stateSelect = StateSelect.default:
  pump.medium.h
